Getting to understand GitHub flow
My name is Bongumusa Bright Sifundza, 23 years of age. I'm an extrovert and an outdoor person. I believe in the power of unity, a better world with less conflicts and equal opportunities for everyone. And i do know that one day we will move to that world through the power of the digital world that is being created.
